## Reflection Questions

1.How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
This made the coding process much easier, because styling is probably the most difficult and tedious however, having the styles established for me not only made it quicker but much easier to understand. 

2.What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
I had a lot of trouble styling the Learning card, I continued to get weird spacing and extra padding that I could not pin point where it was coming from. I learned that Css prefers specific tags first and that specificity like the tag then the class or ID will help me target or override something.

3.How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
The feedback from Frontend mentor can help by giving assistance or suggestions on ways to make our code more organized, concise, or easier. It also serves as an opportunity to not be stuck in our ways when coding and recognizing multiple paths to do the same thing.
