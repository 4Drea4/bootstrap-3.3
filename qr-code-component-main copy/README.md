## Reflection Questions

1. What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
It was difficult to get into the rhythm of originally. In theory I see how when you have the muscle memory, it will be a lot easier. But overall getting things centered in a new way, the color was something that slowed me down a bit. 

2. How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
This made styling a lot easier because there were so many utility classes that replaced practically all of my CSS, making a lot of what was in my CSS uneccessary. 

3. In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?

If there are many design necesseties and specificity that are not easily covered in utilities or if you wanted to have a global css I believe it would make sense to do css. Even then it may benefit you to use a few pieces of bootstrap from time to time.
